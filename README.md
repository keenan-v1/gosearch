# gosearch
Learning Google Go

This is a little project to help me learn and understand Go. 
It's a command line (console) search wrapper for Google, using the custom search API.

### Syntax
Without arguments, gosearch will ask you for your query, or you can use this syntax on the command line:

```
gosearch <keywords>
```
